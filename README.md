collaborative PDF reading and annotation

## Next steps

1. File upload
    * would be nice for the user to be able to browse for/drag in a local pdf file and have that uploaded to our server and their remote participants able to view/annotate it.
1. User accounts
    * whether our own system, or just OAuth with another (e.g. canvas), it owuld be nice to have users accounts
1. Persistence
    * if folks take time to annotate a pdf, it would be nice for us to remember their work for them.
